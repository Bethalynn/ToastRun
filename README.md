ToastRun is a game coded using the "Trex game" concept. The game starts off with a Toast character running with a white background. On the top left, the score and the lives remaining can be seen. You start off with 3 lives. Along the way, the Toast character will come across two items; the knife and the avocado. When the Toast comes into contact with the knife, one life will be lost. To avoid the knife, the Toast can jump over it. To jump, press the spacebar. When the Toast comes into contact with the avocado, one score will be earned. The game only ends when all lives are lost.
